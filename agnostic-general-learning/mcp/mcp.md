# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

## What is MCP?
Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a set of standards, strategies, and best practices for managing, structuring, and communicating context to and from AI models. MCP is essential for maximizing the effectiveness, safety, and reliability of large language models (LLMs) and other AI systems in real-world workflows.

## Scope of This Grouping
This grouping covers:
- How to structure and deliver context to models (prompts, instructions, history, etc.)
- Techniques for managing context window limitations (chunking, summarization, injection)
- Protocols for safe, efficient, and reproducible model interactions
- Best practices for prompt engineering, context compression, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
- Security and safety considerations (e.g., prompt injection attacks)

## Why MCP Matters
- Ensures models have the right information to perform tasks accurately
- Prevents context loss, truncation, or miscommunication
- Enables advanced workflows (multi-step, multi-turn, retrieval-augmented, etc.)
- Supports safe, auditable, and maintainable AI deployments

## Included Explainers
- `context-window.md`: Understanding and managing the model's context window
- `context-chunking.md`: Breaking up large inputs to fit within context limits
- `context-injection.md`: Programmatically adding relevant information to prompts

*This file must be updated whenever new explainers are added or new considerations arise in MCP workflows.*

## Key Points
- MCP is foundational for effective, safe, and scalable use of LLMs and AI agents.
- Context window management is a core challenge for all LLM workflows.
- Chunking, injection, and prompt engineering are key MCP techniques.
- Security (e.g., prompt injection attacks) is a critical concern in context management.
- MCP best practices evolve rapidly as new models and workflows emerge.

## Benefits and Drawbacks
- **Benefits:**
  - Maximizes model performance and reliability.
  - Enables advanced, multi-step, and multi-turn workflows.
  - Reduces risk of context loss, truncation, or miscommunication.
  - Supports safe, auditable, and maintainable AI deployments.
- **Drawbacks:**
  - Requires ongoing learning as models and best practices evolve.
  - Can add complexity to prompt and workflow design.
  - Security risks (e.g., prompt injection) require vigilance.

## Technical Explanation
MCP encompasses the full lifecycle of context management for LLMs:
- **Context window management:** Ensuring all input (prompts, instructions, history, etc.) fits within the model's token limit.
- **Chunking:** Splitting large inputs into manageable pieces, often with overlap for continuity.
- **Context injection:** Programmatically adding relevant data, instructions, or examples to the prompt.
- **Prompt engineering:** Designing prompts for clarity, safety, and optimal model behavior.
- **Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG):** Dynamically retrieving and injecting external knowledge.
- **Security:** Preventing prompt injection attacks and ensuring safe context handling.

## Nontechnical Explanation
Think of MCP as the "rules of the road" for talking to AI models. Just like you need to give clear directions and not overload someone with too much information, MCP helps you organize and deliver the right info to the AI so it can help you best. It also makes sure you don't accidentally give the AI something confusing or unsafe.

## Key Terms
- **Context Window:** The maximum number of tokens a model can process at once.
- **Chunking:** Breaking up large inputs to fit within the context window.
- **Context Injection:** Adding relevant info to the prompt.
- **Prompt Engineering:** Crafting prompts for optimal results.
- **RAG:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation, a technique for injecting external knowledge.
- **Prompt Injection:** A security risk where malicious input alters model behavior.

## Notes on Applicability to Stack
- MCP is relevant for all LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.) and any workflow that uses prompt-based AI.
- Best practices may differ by model, API, or deployment environment.

## Example Use
- Designing a workflow that summarizes a long document by chunking it and injecting relevant context into each prompt.
- Building a chat system that manages conversation history to fit within the model's context window.
- Implementing RAG to answer questions using both user input and retrieved knowledge.

## Setup
1. Identify your model's context window and tokenization method.
2. Design prompts and context management strategies (chunking, injection, etc.).
3. Implement security checks to prevent prompt injection.
4. Test workflows for context fit, performance, and safety.

## Commands
- No direct commands, but you can use tools like:
  - `npx gpt-tokenizer "your text here"` to estimate token counts

## More
- MCP is a rapidly evolving fieldâ€”stay up to date with new research and best practices.
- Community resources (OpenAI Cookbook, LangChain, Anthropic docs) are valuable for learning advanced MCP techniques.

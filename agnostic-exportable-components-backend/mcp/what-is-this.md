# What Is This? (MCP Notification Backend)

This file provides a high-level explainer for the MCP notification backend exportable grouping. It summarizes the purpose, structure, and configuration of each file/component, and clarifies the grouping's readiness for export and integration.

---

## Grouping Overview
This grouping provides a complete, exportable backend notification system for Model Context Protocol (MCP) workflows. It includes a notification controller, models for notifications and user preferences, utilities for sending notifications via email, SMS, and in-app, and routing logic for channel selection. All code is designed for easy integration into any Node.js/Express backend, but is adaptable to other stacks.

**Ready for export and integration.**

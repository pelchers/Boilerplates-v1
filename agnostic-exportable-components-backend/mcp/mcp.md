# MCP Notification Backend (Exportable)

## What is This Grouping?
This grouping provides a backend-agnostic, exportable notification system for Model Context Protocol (MCP) workflows. It enables sending notifications to users via email, in-app notification bell, or SMS, with routing logic based on the importance and context of the notification. Designed for easy integration into any Node.js/Express backend.

## Scope of This Grouping
- Notification controller and service logic for:
  - Email notifications (e.g., for important updates)
  - In-app notifications (e.g., for routine or informational updates)
  - SMS notifications (e.g., for urgent or high-priority alerts)
- Models for notification data and user preferences
- Utilities for formatting, sending, and logging notifications
- Exportable, framework-agnostic code (no hard dependencies on specific app structure)

## Why This Grouping Matters
- Centralizes notification logic for all MCP-related events
- Ensures users receive the right information through the right channel
- Supports compliance, auditability, and user preference management
- Reduces duplication and complexity in multi-channel notification workflows

## Included Files/Explainers
- `server/controllers/NotificationController.ts`: Main controller for handling notification requests
- `server/models/Notification.ts`: Notification data model
- `server/models/UserPreference.ts`: User notification preference model
- `server/utils/emailSender.ts`: Utility for sending emails
- `server/utils/smsSender.ts`: Utility for sending SMS
- `server/utils/inAppNotifier.ts`: Utility for in-app notifications
- `server/utils/notificationRouter.ts`: Logic for routing notifications by importance/context

```

## Key Points
- Supports multi-channel notifications (email, in-app, SMS)
- Routing logic is based on notification importance/context and user preferences
- Designed for easy export and integration into any backend
- Utilities are modular and can be swapped for project-specific implementations
- No empty folders—only include folders/files with actual code

## Benefits and Drawbacks
- **Benefits:**
  - Centralizes and standardizes notification logic
  - Improves user experience and engagement
  - Reduces code duplication across projects
  - Easy to test and extend
- **Drawbacks:**
  - Requires integration with actual email/SMS providers
  - Needs adaptation for project-specific user models or notification channels

## Technical Explanation
The system exposes a controller endpoint for creating notifications. Based on the notification's importance and user preferences, the `notificationRouter` utility determines whether to send an email, in-app, or SMS notification. Each channel has its own utility for formatting and sending messages. Models define the structure for notifications and user preferences, supporting extensibility for new channels or rules.

## Nontechnical Explanation
Think of this as a smart mailroom for your app: when something happens (like an update or alert), the system decides whether to send an email, a text, or just a bell notification in the app—based on how important it is and what the user prefers. Everything is organized so you can easily plug it into any backend.

## Key Terms
- **MCP:** Model Context Protocol
- **Notification Channel:** Email, in-app, or SMS
- **User Preference:** User's chosen way to receive notifications
- **Controller:** Handles incoming API requests
- **Router:** Decides which channel to use

## Resources
- [NodeMailer (Email)](https://nodemailer.com/about/)
- [Twilio (SMS)](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/send-messages)
- [Express Controllers](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html)

## Notes on Applicability
- Can be integrated into any Node.js/Express backend
- Utilities can be swapped for other providers (SendGrid, AWS SNS, etc.)
- User model integration may require adaptation

## Example Use
- When a user receives an important security update, the system sends an email and an in-app notification
- For a routine update, only an in-app notification is sent
- For urgent alerts, an SMS is sent in addition to other channels

## Setup
1. Copy the `mcp/` folder into your backend project
2. Integrate the controller with your API routing
3. Connect utilities to your email/SMS/in-app providers
4. Adapt models to your user schema as needed
5. Test notification flows for all channels

## Commands
- No direct commands, but you may use:
  - `npm install nodemailer` (for email)
  - `npm install twilio` (for SMS)

## More
- Add new channels (push, Slack, etc.) by extending the router and utilities
- Consider logging and analytics for notification delivery and engagement

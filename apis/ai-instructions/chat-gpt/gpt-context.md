# GPT Context for API Integrations

This file provides the context for all AI-powered API projects in this workspace. It is intended for use by AI assistants (such as ChatGPT) to understand the project scope, requirements, and structure before any code is generated.

---

## üìñ Project Context
- **App Type:** API integrations, automation, and orchestration
- **Reference Files:** For ChatGPT, all relevant documentation and requirements are available in the reference files of the chatgpt project and are also imported directly into the chat context as needed.
- **Goal:** Build robust, extensible, and secure API products that can be integrated with web apps, automation tools, and AI-powered flows.

## üìù Instructions for AI Chat
- Before generating code or making changes, relay your understanding of:
  - Project scope and goals
  - Functional and non-functional requirements
  - Stack specifications (Node.js, Express, Vite, React, Tailwind, etc.)
  - Folder/file structure and organization
  - Any additional specifications or conventions provided in the reference files
- Await explicit user approval of your understanding before proceeding to build or modify code.

---

## üìÇ Folder Structure Reference
- All documentation and requirements are organized in the reference files and subfolders of the chatgpt project.
- Use these files to inform all architectural, design, and implementation decisions.

## ‚úÖ Next Step
- Summarize your understanding of the above for user approval before starting any build or code generation.

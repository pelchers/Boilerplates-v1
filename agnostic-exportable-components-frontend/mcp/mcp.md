# MCP Notification Frontend (Exportable)

## What is This Grouping?
This grouping provides a frontend-agnostic, exportable notification UI system for Model Context Protocol (MCP) workflows. It enables displaying notifications to users via a notification bell, toast popups, and an inbox panel, with logic for marking as read, filtering, and real-time updates. Designed for easy integration into any Vite+React+Tailwind frontend, but adaptable to other stacks.

## Scope of This Grouping
- Notification bell component with unread count
- Toast notification system for real-time alerts
- Notification inbox panel for viewing and managing all notifications
- Hooks/utilities for fetching, updating, and marking notifications as read
- TailwindCSS base styles for all components
- Exportable, framework-agnostic code (no hard dependencies on app structure)

## Why This Grouping Matters
- Centralizes notification UI logic for all MCP-related events
- Ensures users see important updates in a consistent, user-friendly way
- Supports real-time updates, accessibility, and user engagement
- Reduces duplication and complexity in notification UI across projects

## Included Files/Explainers
- `client/components/NotificationBell.tsx`: Notification bell with unread badge
- `client/components/NotificationToast.tsx`: Toast popup for new notifications
- `client/components/NotificationInbox.tsx`: Full notification inbox panel
- `client/hooks/useNotifications.ts`: Hook for fetching and managing notifications
- `client/utils/notificationApi.ts`: Utility for API calls to backend MCP notification endpoints
- `client/styles/notification-base-styles.ts`: Tailwind base styles for notification UI

## Key Points
- Supports notification bell, toast, and inbox UI
- Real-time updates via polling or websockets (extensible)
- Mark as read, filter, and manage notifications
- Designed for easy export and integration into any frontend
- Uses TailwindCSS for styling
- No empty foldersâ€”only include folders/files with actual code

## Benefits and Drawbacks
- **Benefits:**
  - Centralizes and standardizes notification UI
  - Improves user experience and engagement
  - Reduces code duplication across projects
  - Easy to test and extend
- **Drawbacks:**
  - Requires integration with backend MCP notification API
  - Needs adaptation for project-specific notification data models

## Technical Explanation
The system provides a set of React components and hooks for displaying and managing notifications. The `useNotifications` hook fetches notifications from the backend, manages state, and provides methods for marking as read. The bell, toast, and inbox components consume this hook and display notifications accordingly. The API utility abstracts backend calls, and all components use TailwindCSS base styles for consistency.

## Nontechnical Explanation
Think of this as a ready-made notification center for your app: users see a bell with their unread count, get pop-up alerts for new messages, and can open an inbox to see all their notifications. Everything is styled and organized so you can easily plug it into any frontend.

## Key Terms
- **MCP:** Model Context Protocol
- **Notification Bell:** Icon showing unread count
- **Toast:** Popup alert for new notifications
- **Inbox:** Panel listing all notifications
- **Hook:** React logic for state and effects

## Resources
- [React Hooks](https://react.dev/reference/react)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)
- [React Toasts](https://fkhadra.github.io/react-toastify/introduction)

## Notes on Applicability
- Can be integrated into any Vite+React+Tailwind frontend
- API utility can be adapted for any backend notification endpoint
- Notification data model may require adaptation

## Example Use
- When a user receives a new notification, a toast appears and the bell count increases
- Clicking the bell opens the inbox panel, where notifications can be marked as read
- Real-time updates can be enabled via polling or websockets

## Setup
1. Copy the `mcp/` folder into your frontend project
2. Import and use the components in your app layout
3. Connect the API utility to your backend MCP notification endpoints
4. Adapt the notification data model as needed
5. Test notification flows for all UI components

## Commands
- No direct commands, but you may use:
  - `npm install axios` (for API calls)
  - `npm install react-toastify` (for toasts, if desired)

## More
- Add new notification UI patterns (e.g., banners, modals) by extending components
- Consider accessibility and mobile responsiveness in all UI

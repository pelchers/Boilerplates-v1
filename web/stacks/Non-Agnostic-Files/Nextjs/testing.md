---

## 1. Overview

This guide details all major testing strategies for Next.js web projects, including unit, integration, E2E, and accessibility testing, with actionable steps and best practices.

## 2. Unit & Integration Testing

- **Tools:** Jest, @testing-library/react, @testing-library/jest-dom
- **Setup:**
  - Install: `npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom`
  - Configure `jest.config.js` for Next.js
- **Run:** `npm test`
- **Best Practices:**
  - Test components, pages, and logic in isolation
  - Mock API calls as needed

## 3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing

- **Tools:** Cypress, Playwright
- **Setup:**
  - Install Cypress: `npm install --save-dev cypress`
  - Install Playwright: `npm install --save-dev playwright`
- **Run:**
  - `npx cypress open` or `npx playwright test`
- **Best Practices:**
  - Use stable selectors (data-testid)
  - Test all major flows (auth, posting, voting, etc.)

## 5. CI/CD & Automation

- **Popular CI:** GitHub Actions, Netlify CI, Vercel CI
- **Automate:**
  - Run Jest and E2E tests on every PR
  - Use Next.js build scripts for deployment
- **Example GitHub Actions step:**
  ```yaml
  - name: Run tests
    run: npm test
  ```

---

## 6. Example Commands & Configs

- Run all tests: `npm test`
- Start dev server: `npm run dev`
- Cypress test: `npx cypress open`
- Playwright test: `npx playwright test`

---

## 7. Best Practices

- Always test accessibility and SEO before release
- Use data-testid for E2E selectors
- Automate tests in CI
- Keep test coverage high for critical flows
- Test production builds before deployment

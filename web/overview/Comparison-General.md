# Web App Stack Comparison by Developer Fit, Minimal Change, and Learning Curve

> **Note:** This overview is for web-only (non-multiplatform) apps, fully optimized for both mobile and desktop viewing, with a focus on best SEO and accessibility practices.

This document compares top frameworks and approaches for building modern web apps, by three major criteria:

1. **Most Web-Dev-Friendly (Vite/React Ecosystem, SEO, Accessibility)**
2. **Most Minimal Change for Responsive, SEO-Optimized Web Apps**
3. **Easiest Learning Curve (Platform-Agnostic Simplicity)**

At the end, a **composite intersection matrix** helps identify which approach fits multiple priorities.

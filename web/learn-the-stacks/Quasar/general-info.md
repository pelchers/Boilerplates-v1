# Quasar: General Info

## What is it?
Quasar is a Vue-based framework for building high-performance web, mobile, and desktop apps from a single codebase. It provides a powerful CLI, a rich set of UI components, and supports SSR, SSG, PWA, Electron, and Cordova/Capacitor for cross-platform deployment. Quasar is especially popular for teams wanting to target multiple platforms with a unified Vue codebase.

---

## Philosophy & Architecture
- **Philosophy:**
  - "Write once, deploy everywhere": Build web, mobile, and desktop apps from one codebase.
  - Focuses on developer productivity, performance, and a rich UI toolkit.
  - Convention-driven, but highly configurable.
- **Architecture:**
  - **Component-based:** Built on Vue 3, with a large set of Quasar UI components.
  - **Plugins:** Built-in plugins for dialogs, notifications, storage, etc.
  - **Routing:** Vue Router, with SSR/SSG support.
  - **State Management:** Pinia (Vuex previously), or any Vue-compatible store.
  - **SSR/SSG:** Built-in, with Quasar CLI configuration.
  - **PWA/Electron/Cordova:** Built-in support for cross-platform builds.
  - **TypeScript:** Supported, but not required.
  - **Styling:** Tailwind, Quasar CSS utilities, Sass, or CSS modules.
  - **Testing:** Cypress, Vitest, Jest, Playwright.

## Ecosystem & Tooling
- **Quasar CLI:** Powerful CLI for scaffolding, building, and deploying to web, PWA, Electron, Cordova, and Capacitor.
- **UI Components:** 70+ high-quality, accessible components.
- **Dev Tools:** Quasar Devtools, Vue Devtools, Prettier, ESLint.
- **State Management:** Pinia, Vuex, or custom stores.
- **CI/CD:** Works with all major CI/CD providers.

---

## SSR/SSG Options
- **SSR:** Built-in, with Quasar CLI configuration.
- **SSG:** Built-in, for static site generation.
- **SEO:** SSR/SSG, meta tags, and Quasar Head plugin.

---

## Routing
- **Vue Router:**
  - Define routes in `src/router/routes.js` or `.ts`.
  - Supports nested, dynamic, and protected routes.
  - Route guards for authentication and permissions.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Organize routes by feature or domain.
  - Use lazy loading for large sections.
  - Use guards for protected routes.

---

## API Communication
- **Axios:** Commonly used for REST/GraphQL APIs.
- **Quasar Plugins:** For HTTP, storage, and more.
- **GraphQL:** Use Apollo Client or urql if needed.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Use composables or Pinia stores for API logic.
  - Use interceptors for auth and error handling.
  - Use environment variables for API endpoints.

---

## File Referencing & Project Structure
- **Common Structure:**
  ```plaintext
  src/
    components/
    pages/
    layouts/
    router/
    store/
    boot/
    assets/
    css/
  quasar.config.js
  tailwind.config.js
  package.json
  tsconfig.json
  ```
- **File Referencing:**
  - Use relative imports or `@` alias for `src/`.
  - Organize by feature or domain.
  - Use `assets/` for images, fonts, etc.

---

## Dev Workflow
- Scaffold: `quasar create my-app`
- Start dev server: `quasar dev`
- Build for web: `quasar build`
- Build for PWA: `quasar build -m pwa`
- Build for Electron: `quasar build -m electron`
- Build for mobile: `quasar build -m capacitor` or `-m cordova`
- Test: `quasar test`
- Deploy to Vercel, Netlify, Render, or any Node host
- Use Quasar CLI, Vue 3, and Tailwind for best DX

---

## Strengths
- SSR/SSG, routing, state, and UI built-in
- Write once, deploy everywhere (web, PWA, mobile, desktop)
- Huge set of high-quality UI components
- Vue 3, TypeScript, and Tailwind support
- Easy deployment (Vercel, Netlify, Node, etc.)
- Convention-driven, but highly configurable

---

## Weaknesses
- Learning curve for CLI and cross-platform config
- Bundle size can grow with many components/plugins
- Less flexible than pure Vite + Vue for custom setups
- SSR/SSG setup is more complex than Nuxt or Astro
- Smaller ecosystem than React/Next.js

---

## Best Practices
- Use composables and Pinia for state and API logic
- Use Quasar plugins for dialogs, notifications, etc.
- Use Prettier and ESLint for code quality
- Organize by feature/domain for scalability

---

## When NOT to Use
- If you want minimal conventions and maximum flexibility (consider Vite + Vue)
- If you want a small, simple SPA or static site
- If you want a non-Vue stack
- If you want SSR/SSG with minimal config (consider Nuxt, Astro)

---

## Real-World Example Use Cases
- Cross-platform business apps (web, mobile, desktop)
- Admin dashboards and portals
- SaaS platforms with multi-platform needs
- Internal tools for distributed teams
- PWA-first apps

# Explanatory Sections for Table-Overview_Comparison.md Rankings

## 1. SSR/SSG (Rank: 5)
- **Explanation:** Quasar provides SSR and SSG out of the box, but setup is more complex than Nuxt or Astro. SSR/SSG is powerful, but requires understanding of Quasar CLI and config.

## 2. SEO (Rank: 5)
- **Explanation:** SEO is strong with SSR/SSG, meta tags, and Quasar Head plugin. Not as automatic as Nuxt or Astro, but highly capable.

## 3. Mobile (Rank: 11)
- **Explanation:** Quasar is the top-ranked stack for mobile. It provides first-class support for PWA, Cordova, and Capacitor, enabling true cross-platform (web, mobile, desktop) from one codebase.

## 4. Accessibility (A11y) (Rank: 5)
- **Explanation:** Quasar UI components are accessible by default, and the framework encourages best practices. Accessibility is strong, but as with all frameworks, depends on developer implementation.

## 5. Most Customizable (Rank: 4)
- **Explanation:** Quasar is highly configurable, with many CLI and build options. You can customize most aspects, but some conventions (Quasar CLI, file structure) are enforced.

## 6. Least Setup (Rank: 4)
- **Explanation:** Setup is straightforward with Quasar CLI, but cross-platform and SSR/SSG features require more config than Nuxt or Astro. Still easier than pure Vite + Vue for multi-platform.

## 7. Least Work (Rank: 4)
- **Explanation:** For cross-platform apps, Quasar reduces work with built-in UI, routing, and deployment. For simple web apps, it may feel like more work than needed. For complex, multi-platform apps, it saves significant time.

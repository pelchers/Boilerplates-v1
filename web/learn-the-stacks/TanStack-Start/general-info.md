# TanStack Start: General Info

## What is it?
TanStack Start is a modern, data-centric React framework for building web apps with flexible, type-safe routing and advanced data loading. It is designed for developers who want maximum control over routing, data fetching, and rendering, while still benefiting from a batteries-included approach for SSR/SSG, layouts, and code-splitting. TanStack Start is especially popular for data-heavy dashboards, custom web apps, and projects needing fine-grained routing and data control.

## Philosophy & Architecture
- **Philosophy:**
  - "Bring your own everything" but with strong, type-safe conventions for routing and data.
  - Focuses on data loading, mutations, and caching as first-class citizens.
  - Encourages modular, composable, and scalable app architecture.
- **Architecture:**
  - **File-based routing:** Uses a `routes/` directory with nested folders and files for routes.
  - **Type-safe routes:** All routes and params are fully typed.
  - **Data loaders and actions:** Fetch data and handle mutations at the route level.
  - **SSR/SSG:** Built-in support for both, with per-route configuration.
  - **Layouts:** Nested layouts for shared UI and data.
  - **React + TypeScript:** First-class support for both.
  - **State management:** Use React Query, Zustand, or any React state library.
  - **Styling:** Use Tailwind, CSS modules, or any CSS-in-JS solution.

---

## Ecosystem & Tooling
- **TanStack Libraries:** React Query, Router, Table, Form, Virtual, etc.
- **TypeScript:** Deep integration and type safety throughout.
- **Testing:** Vitest, Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress.
- **Dev Tools:** TanStack Router Devtools, React DevTools, Prettier, ESLint.
- **Deployment:** Works with Vercel, Netlify, Render, or any Node host.

---

## SSR/SSG
- **SSR:** Server-side rendering for dynamic, personalized, or frequently updated pages.
- **SSG:** Static site generation for fast, cacheable pages.
- **Per-route config:** Choose SSR, SSG, or CSR for each route.
- **SEO:** Manual but flexible; use React Helmet or similar for meta tags.

---

## Routing
- **File-based routing:**
  - Organize routes in `src/routes/` with nested folders/files.
  - Dynamic routes: `[id].tsx`, `[...slug].tsx`.
  - Nested layouts and route groups.
  - Type-safe params and loaders.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Use loaders for data fetching at the route level.
  - Use actions for mutations (forms, updates).
  - Use layouts for shared UI and data.

---

## API Communication
- **React Query:** For data fetching, caching, and background updates.
- **Loaders:** Fetch data at the route level, server or client.
- **Actions:** Handle mutations (POST, PUT, DELETE) at the route level.
- **Fetch/axios:** Use for custom API calls.
- **GraphQL:** Use Apollo Client or urql if needed.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Centralize API logic in loaders and actions.
  - Use React Query for client-side data and caching.
  - Use environment variables for API endpoints.

---

## File Referencing & Project Structure
- **Common Structure:**
  ```plaintext
  src/
    routes/
      (route files and folders)
    components/
    layouts/
    hooks/
    styles/
    utils/
  public/
  tailwind.config.js
  tsconfig.json
  package.json
  ```
- **File Referencing:**
  - Use relative imports or `@/` alias for `src/`.
  - Organize components and utilities by feature or domain.
  - Use `public/` for static assets.

---

## Dev Workflow
- Scaffold: `npm create tanstack@latest`
- Start dev server: `npm run dev`
- Build: `npm run build`
- Preview: `npm run preview`
- Add TanStack libraries (Query, Table, Form, etc.) as needed
- Use TypeScript and Tailwind for best DX

---

## Strengths
- Type-safe, file-based routing
- Per-route data loaders and actions
- SSR/SSG/CSR per route
- Deep React Query integration for data
- Modular, composable architecture
- Great for data-heavy, custom, or dashboard apps
- Flexible styling and state management

---

## Weaknesses
- Smaller ecosystem than Next.js or Astro
- More manual setup for SEO and meta tags
- Learning curve for advanced routing/data patterns
- Not as batteries-included as Next.js for some features
- SSR/SSG requires understanding of loaders/actions

---

## Best Practices
- Use loaders for all data fetching
- Use actions for all mutations
- Use layouts for shared UI/data
- Use React Query for client-side data
- Use Prettier and ESLint for code quality
- Organize by feature/domain for scalability

---

## When NOT to Use
- If you want a huge ecosystem and lots of plugins (consider Next.js, Astro)
- If you want SSR/SSG/SEO fully automated (consider Next.js, Astro, Nuxt)
- If you want a simple SPA with minimal routing/data needs
- If you want a non-React stack (Vue, Svelte, etc.)

---

## Real-World Example Use Cases
- Data-heavy dashboards (analytics, BI, admin panels)
- Custom web apps with complex routing/data needs
- SaaS platforms with dynamic data
- Internal tools and portals
- Multi-tenant or multi-user apps

# Explanatory Sections for Table-Overview_Comparison.md Rankings

## 1. SSR/SSG (Rank: 4)
- **Explanation:** TanStack Start supports SSR and SSG per route, but requires more manual setup and understanding of loaders/actions than Next.js or Astro. Still, it's very flexible and powerful for advanced use cases.

## 2. SEO (Rank: 4)
- **Explanation:** SEO is possible but manual. You must add meta tags and handle SEO logic yourself (React Helmet, etc.). No built-in SEO automation, but full flexibility.

## 3. Mobile (Rank: 8)
- **Explanation:** Mobile optimization is easy with Tailwind or CSS modules. The stack is responsive by default, but you must implement mobile best practices yourself.

## 4. Accessibility (A11y) (Rank: 8)
- **Explanation:** Accessibility is as good as you make it. Use semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, and accessible component libraries. No built-in enforcement, but no limitations either.

## 5. Most Customizable (Rank: 9)
- **Explanation:** TanStack Start is highly customizable. You control routing, data, layouts, and state. Some conventions exist, but most things are pluggable and type-safe.

## 6. Least Setup (Rank: 5)
- **Explanation:** Setup is straightforward, but you must add and configure TanStack libraries as needed. More setup than Next.js or Astro, but less than pure Vite + React.

## 7. Least Work (Rank: 5)
- **Explanation:** For data-heavy apps, TanStack Start reduces boilerplate with loaders/actions. For simple apps, it may feel like more work than needed. For complex apps, it saves time in the long run.

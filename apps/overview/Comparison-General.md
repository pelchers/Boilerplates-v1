# Single-Codebase Mobile App Stack Comparison by Developer Fit, Minimal Change, and Learning Curve

> **Note:** This overview is for single-codebase mobile apps (Android/iOS), built with frameworks like React Native, Expo, or Capacitor+React.

This document compares top frameworks and approaches for building modern mobile apps from a single codebase, by three major criteria:

1. **Most Mobile-Dev-Friendly (React Native, Expo, Capacitor+React)**
2. **Most Minimal Change for Android/iOS Deployment**
3. **Easiest Learning Curve (Web-to-Mobile Simplicity)**

At the end, a **composite intersection matrix** helps identify which approach fits multiple priorities.

## 1. Most Mobile Developer Friendly (React Native, Expo, Capacitor+React)

These are best for developers who want to build scalable, performant mobile apps with modern tooling and a single codebase.

### üèÜ Top 3 Stacks:

#### **Expo (React Native)**
* Unified codebase for Android/iOS.
* Fast dev/build, hot reload, and managed workflow.
* Access to native APIs via Expo SDK.

#### **Capacitor + React**
* Web-first, but bridges to native for device features.
* Use standard React and web APIs.
* Access to native plugins for camera, storage, etc.

#### **React Native CLI**
* More control over native modules and configuration.
* Good for advanced native integrations.

### üîç Comparison Table:

| Stack                | Native APIs | Web-to-Mobile | Dev Speed | Mobile UX |
| -------------------- | ---------- | ------------- | --------- | --------- |
| Expo                 | ‚úÖ Yes     | ‚úÖ Yes        | ‚úÖ Yes    | ‚úÖ Yes    |
| Capacitor + React    | ‚úÖ Yes     | ‚úÖ Yes        | ‚úÖ Yes    | ‚úÖ Yes    |
| React Native CLI     | ‚úÖ Yes     | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial    | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial| ‚úÖ Yes    |

## 2. Most Minimal Change for Android/iOS Deployment

These frameworks require the **least code difference** to maintain and deploy mobile apps to both Android and iOS.

### üèÜ Top 3 Stacks:

#### **Expo (React Native)**
* Managed workflow, minimal config for both platforms.
* Unified navigation, theming, and APIs.

#### **Capacitor + React**
* Write once, deploy to web, Android, iOS.
* Minimal platform-specific code.

#### **React Native CLI**
* More setup, but still single codebase.
* Platform-specific code for advanced features.

### üîç Comparison Table:

| Stack                | Android/iOS Parity | Platform Detection | Codebase Mods |
| -------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------- |
| Expo                 | ‚úÖ Yes             | ‚ö†Ô∏è Optional        | Minimal      |
| Capacitor + React    | ‚úÖ Yes             | ‚ö†Ô∏è Optional        | Minimal      |
| React Native CLI     | ‚úÖ Yes             | ‚úÖ Yes             | ‚ö†Ô∏è Some      |

## 3. Easiest Learning Curve (Web-to-Mobile, Managed Workflow)

These are the most accessible tools for **any developer**, especially those coming from web backgrounds.

### üèÜ Top 3 Stacks:

#### **Expo (React Native)**
* Easy onboarding, managed workflow.
* Expo Go for instant device testing.

#### **Capacitor + React**
* Use standard React, web APIs, and plugins.
* Familiar dev environment for web devs.

#### **React Native CLI**
* More setup, but good docs and community.

### üîç Comparison Table:

| Stack                | Beginner-Friendly | Docs & Tutorials | Mobile UX |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | --------------- | --------- |
| Expo                 | ‚úÖ Yes           | ‚úÖ Yes          | ‚úÖ Yes    |
| Capacitor + React    | ‚úÖ Yes           | ‚úÖ Yes          | ‚úÖ Yes    |
| React Native CLI     | ‚úÖ Yes           | ‚úÖ Yes          | ‚úÖ Yes    |

## 4. Composite Intersection Table

This matrix compares the **top stacks** (those that appeared in any section) across all three evaluation dimensions:

| Stack                | Mobile Dev Friendly | Minimal Code Change | Easiest to Learn |
| -------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- | ---------------- |
| Expo                 | ‚úÖ Yes             | ‚úÖ Yes              | ‚úÖ Yes           |
| Capacitor + React    | ‚úÖ Yes             | ‚úÖ Yes              | ‚úÖ Yes           |
| React Native CLI     | ‚úÖ Yes             | ‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate         | ‚úÖ Yes           |

## ‚úÖ Final Takeaway

If you're looking for the **most overlap** across all three criteria:

* ‚úÖ **Expo (React Native)**: Best for rapid development, unified workflow, and mobile UX.
* ‚úÖ **Capacitor + React**: Best for web-to-mobile teams, plugin access, and familiar dev experience.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è **React Native CLI**: Best for advanced native integrations and custom modules.

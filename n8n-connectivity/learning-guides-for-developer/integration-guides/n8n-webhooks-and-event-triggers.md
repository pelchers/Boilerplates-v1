# n8n Webhooks and Event Triggers

ðŸ“– **What This File Does**
This guide explains how to use webhooks and event triggers in n8n to build event-driven workflows, including advanced usage and security tips.

ðŸ”§ **Configuration Notes**
- Webhook URLs are generated per workflow
- Secure webhooks with authentication or secret tokens
- Use HTTPS in production

---

## 1. Setting Up a Webhook Trigger

- Add the **Webhook** node to your workflow
- Choose the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.)
- Copy the generated webhook URL
- Save and activate the workflow to enable the webhook

---

## 2. Using Event Triggers

- Use built-in event triggers (e.g., Schedule, Email, Webhook)
- Combine triggers with other nodes to automate responses

---

## 3. Advanced Usage

- **Custom Payloads:** Parse and use incoming JSON or form data
- **Chaining Workflows:** Use the **Execute Workflow** node to trigger additional workflows
- **Conditional Logic:** Use **IF** and **Switch** nodes to branch based on event data

---

## 4. Security Best Practices

- Use secret tokens or API keys in webhook URLs
- Restrict allowed IPs or use firewall rules
- Always use HTTPS for public webhooks
- Validate incoming payloads before processing

---

## 5. Troubleshooting

- If the webhook doesn't trigger, ensure the workflow is active
- Check the webhook URL and method match your sender
- Use the node output panel to debug incoming data

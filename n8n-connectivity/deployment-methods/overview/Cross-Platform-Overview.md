# n8n Connectivity Deployment Methods (Web App/API + n8n)

This document outlines **top approaches** for connecting n8n to web apps or APIs (self-hosted or managed) for automation and AI-enhanced flows. Each section details:

1. Codebase modification requirements (Y/N, minimal, conditional)
2. File/folder tree structure
3. Webhook/API integration and AI/ML node usage
4. Hosting options for n8n, backend, and frontend

---

## 1. **n8n Cloud + API Integration**

* **Codebase Modifications:** Minimal — connect via webhooks or HTTP nodes.
* **Integration:** Use n8n Cloud's UI to create flows triggered by your app/API.
* **AI/ML:** Add OpenAI/MCP nodes for AI-enhanced automation.

### Example File Tree (Web App + n8n):

```
web-app/
├── src/
│   ├── api/
│   ├── components/
│   └── utils/
├── public/
├── package.json
├── README.md
n8n-cloud (managed)
```

### Notes:

* No server setup for n8n; just connect via webhooks or HTTP.
* Good for SaaS, startups, and quick launches.

## 2. **Self-Hosted n8n + Webhooks**

* **Codebase Modifications:** Minimal — add webhook endpoints to your app/API.
* **Integration:** Use n8n's UI to create flows triggered by your app/API.
* **AI/ML:** Add OpenAI/MCP nodes for AI-enhanced automation.

### Example File Tree (API + n8n):

```
api-backend/
├── src/
│   ├── routes/
│   ├── controllers/
│   └── services/
n8n-selfhosted/
├── docker-compose.yml
├── .env
├── README.md
```

### Notes:

* Full control over n8n instance and integrations.
* Good for regulated industries or custom needs.

---

## 3. **n8n Embedded (Docker/K8s) + Internal API**

* **Codebase Modifications:** Minor — deploy n8n as a service in your stack.
* **Integration:** Use internal APIs for secure, low-latency automation.
* **AI/ML:** Add OpenAI/MCP nodes for AI-enhanced flows.

### Example File Tree (Microservices + n8n):

```
microservices/
├── service-a/
├── service-b/
n8n-embedded/
├── Dockerfile
├── k8s-deployment.yaml
├── README.md
```

### Notes:

* Good for large teams, microservices, and internal tools.
* Requires DevOps knowledge for orchestration.

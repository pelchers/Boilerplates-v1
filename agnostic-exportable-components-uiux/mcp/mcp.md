# MCP Notification UI/UX (Exportable)

## What is This Grouping?
This grouping provides a set of UI/UX primitives and patterns for Model Context Protocol (MCP) notification workflows. It includes notification icons, badges, popover/panel patterns, animation utilities, and accessibility helpers. All code is framework-agnostic and designed for use in any frontend notification UI, regardless of stack.

## Scope of This Grouping
- Notification bell and alert icons (SVG, accessible)
- Unread badge primitives (color, shape, animation)
- Popover/panel UI patterns for notification lists
- Animation utilities for notification entry/exit
- Accessibility helpers (ARIA, focus management)
- Base styles and tokens for notification UI consistency
- Exportable, framework-agnostic code (no React/Vue/Angular dependencies)

## Why This Grouping Matters
- Centralizes notification UI/UX primitives for all MCP-related events
- Ensures visual and interaction consistency across projects
- Supports accessibility, animation, and responsive design
- Reduces duplication and complexity in notification UI/UX across stacks

## Included Files/Explainers
- `bell-icon.svg`: Notification bell SVG icon (accessible)
- `alert-icon.svg`: Alert/notification SVG icon
- `unread-badge.css`: CSS for unread badge (color, shape, animation)
- `popover-pattern.md`: Explainer for popover/panel UI pattern
- `animation-utils.css`: CSS animation utilities for notifications
- `a11y-helpers.md`: Accessibility helpers and ARIA usage
- `notification-tokens.css`: Design tokens for notification UI (colors, spacing, etc.)

## Key Points
- Provides notification icons, badges, popover patterns, and animation utilities
- All code is framework-agnostic (usable in any frontend stack)
- Focus on accessibility and visual consistency
- No empty foldersâ€”only include files with actual code or documentation

## Benefits and Drawbacks
- **Benefits:**
  - Centralizes and standardizes notification UI/UX primitives
  - Improves accessibility and user experience
  - Reduces code duplication across projects
  - Easy to test and extend
- **Drawbacks:**
  - Requires integration into framework-specific components
  - Needs adaptation for project-specific design systems

## Technical Explanation
The system provides SVG icons, CSS for badges and animation, and design tokens for consistent notification UI. Popover and accessibility patterns are documented for easy adoption. All assets are framework-agnostic and can be imported into any frontend project.

## Nontechnical Explanation
Think of this as a toolkit of notification visuals and patterns: bell icons, badges, popovers, and animations you can use in any app, no matter what framework you use. Everything is designed to be accessible and easy to style.

## Key Terms
- **MCP:** Model Context Protocol
- **Notification Icon:** Visual indicator for notifications
- **Badge:** Small indicator for unread count
- **Popover:** Floating panel for notification lists
- **Animation Utility:** CSS for entry/exit effects
- **A11y:** Accessibility helpers

- [ARIA Authoring Practices](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/)

## Notes on Applicability
- Can be integrated into any frontend stack (React, Vue, Angular, etc.)
- CSS and SVG assets can be imported or copied as needed
- Design tokens can be adapted to match your design system

## Example Use
- Use the bell icon and unread badge in a navbar
- Apply popover pattern for notification lists
- Use animation utilities for toast entry/exit
- Add ARIA roles and focus management for accessibility

## Setup
1. Copy the `mcp/` folder into your UI/UX or design system project
2. Import SVGs, CSS, and tokens as needed in your components
3. Follow the popover and accessibility explainers for integration
4. Adapt tokens and styles to match your design system
5. Test notification UI for accessibility and responsiveness

## Commands
- No direct commands; copy/import files as needed

## More
- Add new icons, badge styles, or animation utilities as needed
- Consider documenting usage examples for each asset

# AI & LLM Training: The Basics (Comprehensive Guide)

This file explains the basics of training AI models and LLMs, including data requirements, compute needs, evaluation, and step-by-step instructions for developers.

---

## 1. Data for Training

- LLMs are trained on large, diverse text datasets (books, web, code, etc.).
- Data must be cleaned, deduplicated, and formatted for training.
- **Step-by-step:**
  1. **Collect data:** Download datasets from sources like [Hugging Face Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets), Common Crawl, Wikipedia, etc.
  2. **Clean data:** Remove duplicates, filter out low-quality or irrelevant content.
  3. **Format data:** Convert to plain text or JSONL (one example per line).
  4. **Tokenize:** Use a tokenizer (e.g., from `transformers`) to convert text to tokens.
     ```python
     from transformers import AutoTokenizer
     tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")
     tokens = tokenizer("Hello world!", return_tensors="pt")
     ```

## 2. Compute Requirements

- Training LLMs requires powerful GPUs/TPUs and distributed computing.
- Fine-tuning smaller models can be done on a single GPU or cloud instance (e.g., Google Colab, AWS, Paperspace).
- **Step-by-step:**
  1. **Choose your environment:**
     - Local machine with GPU (NVIDIA recommended)
     - Cloud GPU (Colab, AWS EC2, GCP, Azure, Lambda Labs, etc.)
  2. **Set up drivers and libraries:**
     - Install CUDA, cuDNN, PyTorch/TensorFlow, and `transformers`.
     - Example:
       ```bash
       pip install torch transformers datasets
       ```

## 3. Training Process (with Code)

- Models learn by predicting the next word/token in a sequence (self-supervised learning).
- Training involves many iterations (epochs) over the dataset.
- **Step-by-step (Fine-tuning Example):**
  1. **Load a pretrained model and tokenizer:**
     ```python
     from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
     model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("gpt2")
     tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")
     ```
  2. **Load and preprocess your dataset:**
     ```python
     from datasets import load_dataset
     dataset = load_dataset("wikitext", "wikitext-2-raw-v1")
     # Tokenize dataset (see HF docs for batching)
     ```
  3. **Set up training arguments and Trainer:**
     ```python
     from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments
     training_args = TrainingArguments(output_dir="./results", num_train_epochs=1)
     trainer = Trainer(model=model, args=training_args, train_dataset=..., eval_dataset=...)
     trainer.train()
     ```

## 4. Evaluation

- Models are evaluated on held-out validation/test sets.
- **Metrics:** accuracy, perplexity, BLEU, ROUGE, F1, etc.
- **Step-by-step:**
  1. **Prepare a validation set:** Split your data or use a standard benchmark.
  2. **Run evaluation:**
     ```python
     results = trainer.evaluate()
     print(results)
     ```
  3. **Human evaluation:** For generative tasks, manually review outputs for quality.

## 5. Practical Tips & Best Practices

- Start with a small model and dataset to validate your pipeline.
- Use mixed-precision training (`fp16`) for speed and memory savings.
- Regularly checkpoint your model.
- Monitor GPU/CPU usage and temperature.
- Use early stopping to prevent overfitting.
- Back up your data and results.

## 6. Troubleshooting

- **Out of memory errors:** Reduce batch size, use gradient accumulation, or switch to a smaller model.
- **Slow training:** Use faster storage (SSD), optimize data pipeline, or use distributed training.
- **Poor results:** Check data quality, try different hyperparameters, or increase training time.

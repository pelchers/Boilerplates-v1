# Open Source AI Integration Stack Learning Curve Overview

> **Note:** All approaches support both pure web (React) and multi-platform (Capacitor+React) frontends. Capacitor+React enables deployment to iOS, Android, and web from a single codebase.

This document summarizes the learning curve for the top approaches to integrating open source AI models into custom web or multi-platform apps, using the example of an AI-driven, interactive artboard/presentation workflow builder.

---

## Backend Model Server + API

* **Learning Curve:** Moderate
* **Why:** Requires backend setup, API design, and model hosting. Familiar REST/GraphQL patterns for frontend integration. Works with React or Capacitor+React frontends.

---

## n8n/MCP-Style Orchestration + Custom Nodes

* **Learning Curve:** Low to moderate
* **Why:** Visual flow builder, low-code integration of AI models. Some learning curve for custom node development and orchestration. Works with React or Capacitor+React frontends.

---

## Direct Integration (WASM/JS AI Libraries)

* **Learning Curve:** Low
* **Why:** Simple npm install, no backend required for small models. Good for learning and prototyping, but limited to lightweight models. Works with React or Capacitor+React frontends.
